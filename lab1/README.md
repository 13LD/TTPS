# Example of Refactoring with Ruby

This project goes about transforming an unstructured ruby script of a Guess
Game all the way up to separating it in different classes.

# Usage 

```bash
ruby guess.rb 
```

# Overview

From the moment I started editing the script, the overall steps were:

1. Simplify some of Ruby method calls
2. Separate pieces of logic into functions (global methods)
3. Reorganize lines of code, switching functions as deemed necessary
4. Organize some methods and variables into separate classes
5. Reorganize lines of code, creating new methods on abstractions as necessary
